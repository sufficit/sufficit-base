## 📖 About the Project

`Sufficit.Base` is a foundational library for the entire Sufficit software ecosystem. It provides the most essential and widely-used components, including base classes, core interfaces, utility methods, and data transfer objects (DTOs) that serve as the building blocks for other Sufficit projects.

The goal of this library is to promote code reuse, consistency, and a common development standard across all our applications and services.

### ✨ Key Features

* Core interfaces and abstract base classes for common patterns (e.g., Services, Repositories).
* Commonly used data models and DTOs.
* A rich set of helper classes and extension methods.
* Shared constants, enumerations, and attributes used throughout the ecosystem.

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🛠️ Usage

As a foundational library, `Sufficit.Base` is designed to be a dependency for nearly all other projects within the Sufficit ecosystem.

**Example of a base model usage:**

    using Sufficit.Base;
    
    public class User : IID
    {
        public Guid ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }

**Example of an extension method:**
